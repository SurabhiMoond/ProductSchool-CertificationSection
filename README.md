# ProductSchool Certification Section Clone

This project is a clone of the **ProductSchool** website's **Certification Section**. The purpose of this project was to replicate the certification section using **HTML**, **CSS**, **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Chakra UI** for structuring and styling. It was part of a week-long collaborative effort, and I was responsible for implementing the certification section.
