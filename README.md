# ProductSchool Certification Section Clone

This project is a clone of the Product School website's Certification Section, built using React, TypeScript, and Chakra UI for styling.

## Project Overview

The project was completed as part of a 5-day coding challenge. The main aim of this project was to check my learning skills acquired during my journey at Masai, specifically focusing on my knowledge of React. The challenge involved replicating the look and feel of the Product School Certification Section, emphasizing:

* **Component Structure:** Creating reusable React components for maintainability.
* **Styling:** Utilizing Chakra UI for its ease of use and consistency.
* **Accessibility:** Employing semantic HTML for better accessibility.
